  <h1> Homework #2</h1>
    <p>
        I understand ASP.Net enough at this point to make a website.&nbsp;&nbsp; It won&#39;t look too bad, but it will defintiely need help.&nbsp; I understand how to make the site work wirth a database and how to use classes.</p>
    <p>
        C# is yet another programming language for me.&nbsp; I understand the basics of it and see how it is similar the other languages I have learned.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate semicolons.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        I use this knowledge when supporting 2 different websites.&nbsp; One is straight old aspx pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other is a bit more complex as it is a MVC with a number of other package added in. Both sites work with data from a SQL server.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#39;t work with data files.</p>
    <p>
        I expect to learn more about how to create a site and how to make it work with other systems.&nbsp; I want to learn more about MVC and Nuget packages for sites.</p>
