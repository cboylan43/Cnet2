       <h3>The Plan</h3>
       <p>Finish my last two classes and get a degree</p>
        <h3>The bio</h3>
        <p  class="center-block">I am not born in Cincinnati, though I have lived most of my life here.  I originally went to college for mechancial engineering after working in construction for a couple years.
            At college, I fell in with a bad crowd and learned computers.  At the time, Windows 3 ( not 3.1) just came out and DOS 5 was what we had in the lab.  We had a Novell server and a 10Base2 network. Does anyone remember what that is now?
        
                    </p>
        <p  class="center-block">I took this experience and managed to start a career in the IT field, first douing desk side support and then later moving into a role doing global support of the operating system for over 100,000 PCs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through tihs work I got to travel to Japan, Singapore and a tour of Europe.&nbsp; I am now getting ready to start working for a new company, but details will have to wait.</p>
        <p  class="center-block">At home, I enjoy gardening and I do some volunteer work.&nbsp; I was just given an award for 20 years of server to People Working Cooperatively.&nbsp; 
            The pictuce below is me making maple syrup for the Hamilton County park district many years ago.&nbsp; 
            I used to teach climbing and caving and go on back packing trips all the time.
                </p>
        <p  class="center-block">I am just about ready to graduate.&nbsp; Much like a couple of you, I have this course and the capstone to complete.</p>
